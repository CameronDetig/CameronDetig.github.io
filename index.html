            <p>When I saw Pixar’s posting for the Storage Analytics Internship, it looked like a perfect opportunity to apply the skills I have learned during my MS program!
                I began planning out a small version of the data assistant system described in the job posting. The concept was quite similar to a project I have worked on for Honeywell so I already had a good idea of how it should work.
                My plan was to create a portfolio piece for my application, and to also use it as an opportunity to learn more about AWS and containerization.</p>

                        From working at The Third Floor, I was familiar with the importance of being able to quickly get information on a show or track down a specific file you're looking for.
                        This project seemed like something that would be of real value and be a good application of the LLM / RAG techniques.<br><br>

                        The first problem to sort out was what data source I would use for the project. Luckily, Blender Studio offers open source assets from all of their <a href="https://studio.blender.org/films/">short films</a> going back to 2006.
                        This provided a perfect database that could simulate the sort of production environment that a studio like Pixar would have. 
                        Also, using Blender meant it would be easy to install and use in the data processing container, as opposed to a DCC like Maya that would require a license. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="project-subtitle">Development Process</h4>
                    
                    <p class="project-description">
                        Below is a diagram of the system.
                    </p>

                    <p class="project-description">
                        Antigravity with Claude Sonnet 4.5 was utilized in the development of this project, and was a great help in coding a system this large in the time frame that I had. 
                        It still required a large amount of effort and learning on my part, but allowed me to think bigger picture about the architecture of the system instead of being in the weeds of debugging.
                        <br><br>

                        In my machine learning class last semester, I learned about OpenAI’s CLIP model that is able to create embeddings for both text and images. 
                        This was in the context of using CLIP for text2image diffusion models, but it seemed like a great way to allow users to both enter text descriptions of the file they are looking for, and have the system compare it against thumbnail image embeddings to find similar files. 
                        This would also allow the user to upload an image to the assistant to search for similar thumbnail images.

                    I am a current Computer Science Master’s student with a unique mix of experience in artificial intelligence and VFX / Animation. 
                    I have focused my studies on AI and Machine Learning, particularly in the use of LLMs for gaining insights to large datasets using Retrieval Augmented Generation.
                </p>
                <p class="about-text">
                    My journey began as a previs artist at The Third Floor where I gained experience working on the art side. Using animation and cinematography to visualize scenes for shows such as Ahsoka and Predator: Killer of Killers. 
                    This was an amazing experience and gave me insight to how a professional pipeline runs and the level of data management that is required, using tools like ShotGrid and Perforce to keep everything organized. 
                </p>
                <p class="about-text">
                    This background was a great help in designing the CG Production Assistant and I feel would similarly contribute to the Storage and Backup team at Pixar.
